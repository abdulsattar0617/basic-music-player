## 📁 Project Structure

```
basic-music-player/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/       # Album art / icons
│   └── music/        # MP3 files
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

To run the music player locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdulsattar0617/basic-music-player.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd basic-music-player
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

> No installation or server required. Just open and play!

## 📌 How It Works

- The `script.js` file manages audio playback logic and DOM manipulation.
- Songs are stored in the `/assets/music` folder and dynamically loaded into the player.
- The seek bar and duration are updated in real-time using JavaScript.

## 🧠 Learnings

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Audio API in JavaScript
